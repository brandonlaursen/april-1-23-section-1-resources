  Grid
  * CSS Grid can be used to create an entire page layout, or a specific container element. A grid layout consists of CSS styles applied to:

  * A grid container (parent element)
  * Several grid items (children elements)


  ! to make a container a grid add display: grid
  ! can set size of each col or row
  ! can set how many col or row
  ! give each a name
  ! grid-area on child box to identify box


  Gaps
  ! Gaps refer to the spaces between rows, or between columns. They are basically "gutters". These properties allow us to set the spacing between rows or columns:

  * row-gap - accepts a size value
  * column-gap - accepts a size value


  Justify and align items
  ! these will work on every box in grid
  ! justify-items - aligns items on the row (horizontally)
  ! align-items - aligns items on the column (vertically)
  * start - aligns items with the start line of their cell (left side)
  * end - aligns items with the end line of their cell (right side)
  * center - aligns items in the center of their cell (center)
  * stretch - fills the whole width of the cell (the default value)

 ! if you want to do just a single area in grid
  *  use justify-self or align-self
